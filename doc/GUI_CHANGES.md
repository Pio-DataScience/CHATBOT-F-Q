# GUI Changes Summary

## Changes Made to interface_gui.py

### 1. Removed LLM Configuration Section
**Before:** Users had a checkbox to optionally enable question generation with LLM configuration fields.

**After:** Questions are **always generated automatically** using AI. The LLM settings are set internally:
- LLM Base URL: `http://localhost:1234/v1` (fixed)
- LLM Model: Empty (uses default)
- Users only configure:
  - Min Questions per Section (default: 3)
  - Max Questions per Section (default: 8)
  - Max Words per Question (default: 12)

### 2. Removed Database Sequences Section
**Before:** Users could optionally enter sequence names for CHATBOT_ANSWERS and USER_MANUAL_FAQ tables.

**After:** Sequence names are handled internally (empty strings), allowing Oracle to use its auto-increment or configured sequences automatically.

### 3. Simplified Language Selection
**Before:** 
- Users entered a numeric Language ID (1, 2, etc.)
- Users selected "Answers Language Target" with codes (AR, OTH)
- Confusing: What does OTH mean? What are the Language IDs?

**After:**
- Single dropdown: **"Document Language"** with clear options:
  - English
  - Arabic
- Language mapping is automatic:
  - **English** → lang=2, answers_to="OTH" (OTH = Other languages/English)
  - **Arabic** → lang=1, answers_to="AR"

## Language Code Explanation

### What is OTH?
**OTH** stands for **"Other"** and represents non-Arabic languages, primarily English in your system.

### Language ID Mapping
Based on your database structure:
- **Language ID 1** = Arabic
- **Language ID 2** = English (and other languages)

### Answers Target
- **AR** = Arabic answers (stored in ANSWER_TEXT_AR column)
- **OTH** = Other/English answers (stored in ANSWER_TEXT_OTH column)

## User Experience Improvements

### Before:
```
Console Configuration:
- Select Console: [Dropdown]
- Select Sub-Console: [Dropdown]
- Country Code: [400]
- Institution Code: [1]
- Language ID: [1] ← Confusing!
- Answers Language Target: [OTH] ← What is OTH?
- Bank Map Code: []

LLM Configuration (Optional):
☐ Generate Questions with LLM
[If checked: multiple fields]

Database Sequences (Optional):
- Answers Sequence Name: []
- FAQ Sequence Name: []
```

### After:
```
Console Configuration:
- Select Console: [Dropdown]
- Select Sub-Console: [Dropdown]
- Country Code: [400]
- Institution Code: [1]
- Document Language: [English ▼] ← Clear!
- Bank Map Code: []

Question Generation Settings:
ℹ Questions will be automatically generated using AI
- Min Questions per Section: [3]
- Max Questions per Section: [8]
- Max Words per Question: [12]
```

## Technical Details

### Internal Parameter Mapping

When user selects **English**:
```python
lang = 2
answers_to_code = "OTH"
gen_questions = True
```

When user selects **Arabic**:
```python
lang = 1
answers_to_code = "AR"
gen_questions = True
```

### Fixed Internal Values
```python
lm_base = "http://localhost:1234/v1"
lm_model = ""
seq_ans = ""
seq_faq = ""
gen_questions = True  # Always true
```

## Benefits

1. **Simpler Interface** - Fewer fields, clearer labels
2. **No Confusion** - No technical codes visible to users
3. **Automatic Defaults** - LLM always enabled, sequences handled automatically
4. **Better UX** - "Document Language" is intuitive vs "Language ID" + "Answers Target"
5. **Fewer Errors** - Less chance of incorrect parameter combinations

## Testing

Refresh your Streamlit interface (http://localhost:8501) and you should see:
1. Simplified left column with "Document Language" dropdown
2. Right column showing "Question Generation Settings" 
3. No LLM checkbox or database sequence fields
4. Cleaner, more professional interface

## Next Steps

If you need to change the LLM server URL or other fixed values, they can be:
1. Modified in the code (interface_gui.py)
2. Added to environment variables
3. Added to a configuration file

For now, they're set to sensible defaults that match your system.
